The white wagtail was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, and it still bears its original name Motacilla alba.[4][2] The Latin genus name originally meant "little mover", but certain medieval writers thought it meant "wag-tail", giving rise to a new false Latin word cilla for "tail".[5] The specific epithet alba is Latin for "white".[6]

Within the wagtail genus Motacilla, the white wagtail's closest genetic relatives appear to be other black-and-white wagtails such as the Japanese wagtail Motacilla grandis and the white-browed wagtail Motacilla madaraspatensis (and possibly the Mekong wagtail Motacilla samveasnae, the phylogenetic position of which is mysterious), with which it appears to form a superspecies. However, mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data suggests that the white wagtail is itself polyphyletic or paraphyletic (i.e. the species is not itself a single coherent grouping).[7] Other phylogenetic studies using mtDNA still suggest that there is considerable gene flow within the races and the resulting closeness makes Motacilla alba a single species.[8] A study has suggested the existence of only two groups: the alba group, with M. a. alba, M. a. yarrellii, M. a. baicalensis, M. a. ocularis, M. a. lugens, and M. a. subpersonata; and the alboides group, with M. a. alboides, M. a. leucopsis and M. a. personata.
